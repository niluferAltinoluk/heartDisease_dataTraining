## Project Overview

In this project, we worked with our heart disease dataset. We examined this data set. 
We organized our data set in a format that is open to interpretation.
We set up a pipeline for our data set. We had the best fit model predicted and printed the accuracy values.

## Python Packages Used
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: For numerical operations.
* Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Matplotlib: For data visualization.
* Scikit-learn: For machine learning and data mining.
* Statsmodels :statistical modeling and forecasting

## Data

We have 36 columns in our dataset. Definitions and explanations are as stated in the code.
There are also variations of similar expressions. We have object, integerer, float variables. 

## Code structure

* We start by getting to know our data set.
* We use label encoder for object values.
* We continue to examine and identify relationships using various variations of mathematical tables, heatmap, joinplot, and histogram charts.
* We define our categorical and numerical expressions.
* We create our graphic function for detailed one-on-one reviews for categorical columns.
* We display our numerical values ​​as a heatmap and as a histogram with the help of the function we wrote.
* We drop our ineffective columns that have similar features in other columns.
* We prepare our data set for training.
* We create a Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression pipeline.
* We create variables for our best model selection and accuracy rate.
* We fit our pipelines.
* We define our function that prints accuracy rates.
* We define our function that prints our model selection.
* We obtain results by using these among our other values.
* We also experiment with other data or values ​​that we are curious about.

## Results and evaluation

In this project, we worked with our heart disease data set. We examined their correlations with each other. We observed that some diseases are closely related to each other.
Our dataset was a synthetic dataset. We saw that the risk score is highly related to cholesterol. In our columns that include other diseases, we observed that each disease is in a close situation or that one value is closely related to the other.
The relationship between age score and cholesterol showed us that age is a huge factor in this area. The same was true for risk.

## Future work


In the future, we can examine other situations in our data model and impose restrictions on some columns.
We can select some age groups as a subject group in our data set and try customized algorithms for them.
